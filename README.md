##Bootstraps_bootstraps

[Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) is Twitter's CSS and Javascript framework.  It is a great baseline for starting web applications.  As a CSS/Javascript framework it does a great job of providing a baseline styleset and group of user interface components given that you play within its garden.

[Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) is an open source web framework that does a lot to make web application development easy, secure, and quick.

To get the best experience out of both worlds Rails needs a bit of bootstrapping to get a form builder that plays nice with Bootstrap.  This gem provides the bootstraps that Bootstrap needs to make Rails+Bootstrap a potent combination.

##Development Strategy

More or less I'm writing this library as needed.  Each time I find myself trying to do something with form_for or interact between Rails and Bootstrap I find a way to make them play nice together without losing baseline Rails functionality.
